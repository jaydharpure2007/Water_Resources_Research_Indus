# Declining Groundwater Storage in the Indus basin Revealed Using GRACE and GRACE-FO Data 

The Indus Basin's water resources are at risk due to increasing freshwater demand and climate warming. Using GRACE and GRACE-FO data (2002–2023), a machine learning-based MissForest algorithm was applied to fill 33 months of missing terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data. Results show a declining TWSA trend, which intensified after 2015/16 (-2.16 cm/yr), with 83.7% of the basin experiencing significant groundwater depletion. The non-glaciated region exhibits a steeper decline (-1.44 cm/yr) than the glaciated region (-0.78 cm/yr), with the Panjnad sub-basin showing the highest decrease. Declining precipitation and runoff, alongside increasing evapotranspiration due to vegetation growth, contribute to persistent groundwater loss.

## Key highlights of the research:
- The rate of water storage decline in the Indus Basin more than tripled, from -0.65 cm/yr (2002–2015) to -2.16 cm/yr (2015–2022).
- Groundwater storage in non-glaciated regions (-1.44 cm/yr) declined at nearly twice the rate of glaciated regions (-0.78 cm/yr).
- Water availability in the Indus Basin has decreased due to reduced precipitation and runoff, coupled with increased evapotranspiration and vegetation growth.
