## Declining Groundwater Storage in the Indus basin Revealed Using GRACE and GRACE-FO Data 

The Indus basin's water resources are at risk due to increasing freshwater demand and climate warming. Using GRACE and GRACE-FO data (2002â€“2023), a machine learning-based MissForest algorithm was applied to fill 33 months of missing terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data. Results show a declining TWSA trend, intensifying after 2015/16 (-2.16 cm/yr), with 83.7% of the basin experiencing significant groundwater depletion. The non-glaciated region exhibits a steeper decline (-1.44 cm/yr) than the glaciated region (-0.78 cm/yr), with Panjnad sub-basin showing the highest decrease. Decreasing precipitation and runoff, alongside increasing evapotranspiration due to vegetation growth, contribute to the persistent groundwater loss.
